# React + Strapi website template

This is a website template for building a beautiful website that is 100% editable by non-technical users via a visual admin panel :)

This template contains a demo of how to build an editable website while keeping a good level of control of the design and layout of the website. Non-technical users can use the admin panel to:

- Add new pages to the website, with specific fields defined by the developer (title, header image, body text, etc...)
- Control content on static pages (such as the home page) by editing text and image fields
- Add list-based content such as FAQ's, upcoming events or team members, which are shown in pre-defined places in the app

With this template, developers won't need to hardcode even the smallest pieces of text on the website if they don't want to. In general, it's a good balance between keeping the basic structure of the site in control of the developer, while giving content creators the necessary freedom and tools to edit the website content without having to ask the developer to make changes in the code. 

See below for how to set up the template for development, import some default content into the database, edit the site and eventually deploy it!
